# Email-Domain
This python program is to check wether the mail id is valid or not,ie:
    It must contain only one "@"
    It must contain ".com" at the end
If the id is valid program will print username and domain name seprately
Program will also save the entered mail in a list and that list can only be displayed after giving the security PIN
    A mail will be saved only if its not saved before(if not in the list already)
    PIN is been taken as '4051'
    If the wrong pin is entered once the program will show the warning message
    If the wrong pin entered again the program will be terminated
Program will work on loop untill the user triggers 'exit' statement
